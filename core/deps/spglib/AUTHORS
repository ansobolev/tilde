Library: spglib-1.4.1
Author: Atsushi Togo
Web: http://sourceforge.net/projects/spglib
Packed by: Materials Project, Shyue Ping Ong
Comment: In order for spglib to be compiled properly on most machines with openmp, src/symmetry.c was patched to remove the #include<omp.h> dependency and the setup.py does not contain compiler options to link openmp.
